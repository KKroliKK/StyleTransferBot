# StyleTransferBot
Telegram bot for style transfering on photos via convolutional network

To get started you need to paste your telebot's token (you can receive it from Botfather) and telegram ID (can be found via special bots).
main.py is an entry point of the application

To add your own style photos you need to boot the program and send command /admin in private messages to the Bot.
Via admin menu you can load example photos for /start command and ready-made style photos.

Here is telegram alias of my working application: @S7yleTransferBot
